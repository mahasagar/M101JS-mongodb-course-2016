# Homework: Homework: 4.2

Suppose you are working with a set of categories defined using the following tree structure. "Science" is a sub-category of "Books"; "Chemistry" and "Physics" are sub-categories of "Science"; and "Classical Mechanics" and "Quantum Mechanics" are sub categories of "Physics".

Books
    Science
        Chemistry
        Physics
            Classical Mechanics
            Quantum Mechanics
For this tree, each node is represented by a document in a collection called categories.

Which of the following schemas will make it possible to find() all descendants of a category using a single query. For example, all descendants of "Science" are "Chemistry", "Physics", "Classical Mechanics", and "Quantum Mechanics".

# Answer : 
db.categories.insertOne({"_id": "Quantum Mechanics", "ancestors": ["Books", "Science", "Physics"], "parent": "Physics"})
db.categories.insertOne({"_id": "Classical Mechanics", "ancestors": ["Books", "Science", "Physics"], "parent": "Physics"})
db.categories.insertOne({"_id": "Physics", "ancestors": ["Books", "Science"], "parent": "Science"})
db.categories.insertOne({"_id": "Chemistry", "ancestors": ["Books", "Science"], "parent": "Science"})
db.categories.insertOne({"_id": "Science", "ancestors": ["Books"], "parent": "Books"})
db.categories.insertOne({"_id": "Books", "ancestors": [], "parent": null})
